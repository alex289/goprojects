# Five Go Projects

This repository contains readmes for five different Go projects you can use to learn Go, as
described in the [YouTube video by Dreams of Code](https://youtu.be/gXmznGEW9vo)

Inside of this repository are 5 directories, each representing a single project idea.

Each of the project ideas contain a README and any supplementary resources or advice to help you build 
the project.

## 01 - Todo List CLI

This project is to build a CLI todo list called `tasks`. There is my own built version you can try out
on the releases page

## 02 - Backend API

This project is to build a backend API for a Calculator Service. There is a simple OpenAPI Specification on this
project to help you define the endpoints your API should support.

## 03 - Web Scraper

This project is to build a simple web scraper to detect dead links on a webpage.

## 04 - URL Shortener

This project is to build a URL Shortener website entirely using Go, including both a Web frontend and a backend.

## 05 - Currency Converter

This last project is to build a currency converter for the terminal which uses the huh framework for creating a form and a third part API for obtaining the currency conversion data.


# General Getting Started Advice

For all projects, make sure you start off with a `main.go` and using `go mod init`
